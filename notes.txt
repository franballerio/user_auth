Notes for the process of the creation of the API:
    - we can have different db models for different or even one components, thats the 
    idea of models folder on each component
    - user input validation is solved before calling the db models
    -  passw comparison is done in the db model, bc the model is suposed to be the one that
    handles user data
    - added an error handler for zod schemas
    - send the exact error of the schema to the frontend on register
