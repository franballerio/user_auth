Notes for the process of the creation of the API:
    - we can have different db models for different or even one components, thats the
    idea of models folder on each component
    - user input validation is solved before calling the db models
    -  passw comparison is done in the db model, bc the model is suposed to be the one that
    handles user data
    - added an error handler for zod schemas
    - send the exact error of the schema to the frontend on register

    Refresh Token Implementation Changes:
        - Refresh and normal token uses diff secret key
        - Auth middleware now checks normal and refresh token.
        if refresh isn't revoked, it generates a new normal token
        - save refresh token on databse to be able to revoke it if needed
        - Fixed refresh endpoint to properly validate refresh tokens
        endpoint and auth middleware look to do the same, but the refresh endpoint has to be handle_request
        so the frontend can request a refresh
